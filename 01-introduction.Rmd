Forecasting has come a long way since early humans looked at the sky to
see if the weather would be suitable for hunting, and even since hunters
could get a forecast such as "a high of 40 with a chance of rain". Now a
hunter can look at a smartphone to instantly get hour-by-hour forecasts
of temperatures and probabilities of rain at multiple locations as well
as videos of maps showing forecasted weather patterns over the coming
hours. Tailored forecasts of increasing sophistication can be generated
to inform important decisions of many different types by managers,
public officials, investors, and other decision makers.

In the 15 years since the excellent review paper by
@Gooijer2006-hl_GS, the field of forecasting has seen amazing growth
in both theory and practice. Thus, this review is both timely and broad,
ranging from the highly theoretical to the very applied.

Rapid advances in computing have enabled the analysis of larger and more
complex data sets and stimulated interest in analytics and data science.
As a result, the forecaster's toolbox of methods has grown in size and
sophistication. Computer science has led the way with methods such as
neural networks and other types of machine learning, which are getting a
great deal of attention from forecasters and decision makers. Other
methods, including statistical methods such as Bayesian forecasting and
complex regression models, have also benefited from advances in
computing. And improvements have not been limited to those based on
computing advances. For example, the literature on judgmental
forecasting has expanded considerably, driven largely by the "wisdom of
crowds" notion.

The combining, or aggregation, of forecasts, which is not a new idea,
has received increased attention in the forecasting community recently
and has been shown to perform well. For example, the top-performing
entries in the M4 Competition run by Spyros Makridakis combined
forecasts from multiple methods. Many models have been developed to
forecast the number of deaths that will be caused by COVID-19, and
combining the forecasts makes sense because it is hard to know which one
will be the most accurate. It is consistent with Bayesian ideas since it
can be viewed as updating, with each individual forecast added to the
combined forecast (also called an ensemble) contributing some new
information.

Despite the excitement surrounding these new developments, older methods
such as ARIMA and exponential smoothing are still valuable too.
Exponential smoothing, along with other simple approaches, are quite
robust and not as prone to overfitting as more complex methods. In that
sense, they are useful not only on their own merits, but as part of an
ensemble that also includes more sophisticated methods. Combined
forecasts are more valuable if the forecasts come from methods that are
diverse so that their forecast errors are not highly correlated.

The conditions leading to larger, more sophisticated toolboxes for
forecasters have also led to larger data sets with denser grids and
improved models in areas of application. This has happened with models
of the atmosphere, which are important in formulating improved weather
forecasts. More detailed information about customers and their
preferences allows the development of improved models of customer
behaviour for managers. In turn, forecasting methods that can handle all
of that information quickly are valuable for decision-making purposes.
This process has spurred an explosion in trying to gather information on
the internet.

Risk is an important consideration in decision making, and probability
forecasts can quantify such risks. Theoretical work in probability
forecasting has been active for some time, and decision makers in many
areas of practice have embraced the use of probability forecasts. In the
Bayesian approach, inferences and forecasts are probabilistic in nature,
and probability forecasts can be generated in many other ways too.

The U.S. National Weather Service began issuing probabilities of
precipitation to the public in the 1960s. Yet extensive widespread use
and dissemination of probabilities has only developed since the turn of
the century. Now probability forecasts are increasingly communicated to
the public and used as inputs in decision making. Nate Silver's
[FiveThirtyEight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) report gives probability forecasts for elections,
medicine and science, sporting events, economic measures, and many other
areas, often looking at multiple forecasting models individually and
also combining them.

It is natural for people to desire certainty. When probability forecasts
of precipitation were first disseminated widely, many were very
sceptical about them, with some accusing the forecasters of hedging and
saying "Don't give me a probability. I want to know if it's going to
rain or not". Of course, point forecasts often are given along with
probability forecasts. The current frequent exposure to probabilities
helps the general public better understand, appreciate, and feel more
comfortable with them. And the current situation in the world with
COVID-19, increases in huge fires, big storms, political polarisation,
international conflicts, etc., should help them realise that we are
living in an age with huge uncertainties, and forecasts that quantify
these uncertainties can be important. Where possible, visualisation can
help, as indicated by the saying that a picture is worth a thousand
words. Examples are the cones of uncertainty on maps in forecasts of the
speed, severity, and future path of hurricanes, and the time line of the
probability of a team winning a game, updated quickly after each play.

Put simply, this is an exciting time for the field of forecasting with
all of the new theoretical developments and forecasting applications in
practice. Forecasting is so ubiquitous that it's not possible to cover
all of these developments in a single article. This article manages to
cover quite a few, and a good variety. Using short presentations for
each one from an expert "close to the ground" on that theoretical topic
or field of practice works well to provide a picture of the current
state of the art in forecasting theory and practice.
