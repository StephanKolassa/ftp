[^15]: The demographic literature sometimes makes a distinction between
    unconditional *forecasts* (or *predictions*) and *projections*,
    conditional on their underlying assumptions. In this section, we use
    the former term to refer to statements about the future, and the
    latter to the result of a numerical exercise of combining
    assumptions on fertility, mortality and migration in a deterministic
    model of population renewal.
